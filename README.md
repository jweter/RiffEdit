Riffedit
===========

A web app that takes guitar tab input, and changes the music to create a different melody while keeping the same rhythm.

I decided I would try out some artificial creativity type stuff because I think it is really interesting, and want to see what happens when I use my own band's songs as input! Rhythm is defined by the spacing between the notes. The output is another guitar tab to be played by a guitarist or MIDI software.
